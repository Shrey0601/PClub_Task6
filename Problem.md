Alice and Brett are 2 very intelligent students in the high school. They both are highly interested in Mathematics and keep solving intersting problems. Once they got an intersting problem in hand from their teacher. Now, Teacher decided that whoever is able to solve the problem first will get a prize from her. Brett solved the problem in 1 second. Can you help Alice solve it in lesser time and win the prize ?  </br>
The problem given by the teacher is as follows : </br>
                Given an integer n, find out the number of trios of form (a1,a2,a3) such that </br>
                <b>
                1 <= a1,a2,a3 <= n </br>
                a1 % a2 = a3  </br>
                a2 % a3 = 0   </br>
                </b>
                <h1> </h1>
                <h4> Input </h4>
                Each test contains multiple test cases. </br>
                The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line.
                The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>).

                <h4> Output </h4>
                For each test case, print one integer — the number of trios.
