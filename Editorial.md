# Fun With Numbers
It is given that a2 % a3 = 0. So take a3 = k2*a3. Also a1 % a2 = a3. So a1 = k1*a2 + a3. Here k1,k2 are arbitary psoitive constants. </br>
Consider the case where a2 > a1, so clearly, a1 = a3. Number of such trios is <sub>i=1</sub>âˆ‘<sup>n</sup> (n/i)-1 as n/i-1 are distinct values of a2 greater than a1 and with a3 as factor. </br>
